        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Effective date: February 18, 2026</p>

        <p>Tether ("we", "our", or "the app") is a productivity and accountability app for macOS and iOS. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Tether collects the following data to provide its core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account information</strong> -- your email address and authentication tokens when you create an account.</li>
            <li><strong>Tasks and projects</strong> -- titles, estimates, priorities, and completion status of tasks you create.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus sessions</strong> -- start and end times, duration, pause/resume events, and distraction events (the name of the app you switched to and how long you spent there).</li>
            <li><strong>Blocklists</strong> -- the apps and website domains you choose to block during focus sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Social data</strong> -- friendships, group memberships, and encouragement messages, if you opt in to social features.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings and preferences</strong> -- your app configuration, blocking mode preferences, and notification settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Analytics</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="https://telemetrydeck.com" rel="noopener">TelemetryDeck</a> for privacy-friendly usage analytics. TelemetryDeck does not collect personally identifiable information. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized. It helps us understand which features are used and where the app can be improved. You can opt out of analytics in the app settings.</p>

        <h2>3. Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>We use <a href="https://sentry.io" rel="noopener">Sentry</a> to collect crash reports and diagnostic information. Crash reports include device type, OS version, app version, and stack traces. They do <strong>not</strong> contain personally identifiable information, task content, or session data.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sync</h2>
        <p>When you are signed in, your data syncs with our backend servers so it is available across your devices. Data is transmitted over TLS 1.3 and stored encrypted at rest (AES-256). If you choose not to create an account, your data stays on your device only.</p>

        <h2>5. What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Keystrokes, screen content, or screenshots</li>
            <li>Full URLs or web page content (we only use domain names for blocking)</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Contents of your files or documents</li>
            <li>Microphone recordings (voice input is processed on-device via Apple Speech framework and is never sent to our servers)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI task parsing</strong> -- when you use natural language task planning, your input text is sent to our backend for processing. No conversation history or personal context is retained beyond the immediate request.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Push Notification service (APNs)</strong> -- used to deliver push notifications for social events. Only notification tokens and payloads are shared with Apple; no user content is included.</li>
            <li><strong>TelemetryDeck</strong> -- anonymized usage analytics (see Section 2).</li>
            <li><strong>Sentry</strong> -- crash reporting (see Section 3).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete your account at any time from within the app. When you delete your account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data on our backend servers is permanently deleted within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Local data on your device is wiped immediately.</li>
            <li>Anonymized, aggregated analytics data that cannot be linked back to you may be retained.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data Export</h2>
        <p>You can export all of your data (tasks, sessions, analytics) in JSON or CSV format from the app settings at any time.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Tether is rated 4+ and does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app does not contain ads, in-app purchases directed at children, or social features that expose minors to strangers.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the app or by email. The "effective date" at the top of this page indicates when the policy was last revised.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or your data, contact us at:</p>
