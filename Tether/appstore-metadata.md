## Description

Tether is a productivity app that helps you plan your work, stay focused, and build lasting habits — with friends who keep you accountable.

**Plan in seconds, not minutes.**
Open Tether and describe what you need to do in plain English. Tether's AI-powered parser turns your thoughts into organized tasks with projects, priorities, and time estimates. Speak or type — either way, you go from blank slate to actionable plan in under two minutes.

**Deep focus sessions that actually work.**
Start a focus session and Tether quietly monitors your workflow. If you drift to a distracting app or website, Tether catches it instantly and logs the interruption. At the end of every session, you get an honest summary: how long you focused, what pulled you away, and how you did compared to your goals.

**Block distractions before they start.**
Build a personal blocklist of apps and websites that derail your focus. Choose your blocking strength — a gentle reminder, a hard block, or a timed lock that makes you wait before you can override. Tether blocks distractions on both macOS and iOS, so there is nowhere to hide.

**See your progress, spot your patterns.**
Daily, weekly, and monthly dashboards show your focused time, session counts, distraction rates, task completion, and streaks. Trend charts help you see the bigger picture. Tether's insights engine highlights patterns — like which days you focus best or which apps cost you the most time — so you can make smarter decisions about how you work.

**Stay accountable with friends.**
Invite friends to an accountability group. Share a leaderboard of focused time and session counts. Send encouragement when someone is grinding through a tough session, or a friendly ping when they have been quiet too long. Social features are entirely opt-in, and you control exactly what others can see.

**Privacy by design.**
Tether never records your keystrokes, screen content, or browsing history. Voice input is processed entirely on your device. Analytics are anonymized. You can export or delete all your data at any time.
